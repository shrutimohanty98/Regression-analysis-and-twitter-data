# Regression-analysis-and-twitter-data

Regression analysis is a statistical method for determining the relationship between a target variable and a group of parameters that together provide information about the target. In this research, we investigate regression-specific feature engineering methods and model selection to improve regression performance. We'll perform many experiments to determine the relative importance of various alternatives.

The algorithms compared in this section of the project are - Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Neural Networks, RandomForest, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Bayesian Optimization. 

We also perform some analysis on twitter data with respect to predictions and sentiment analysis.

This project is a part of Winter 2022 Course - Large Scale Data Mining (ECE 219)
